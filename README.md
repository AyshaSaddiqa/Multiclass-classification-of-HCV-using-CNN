# Multiclass Classification of Hepatitis C (HCV) Patients using CNN and Explainable AI (XAI)

This project implements a deep learning-based multiclass classification system for Hepatitis C (HCV) patients, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) alongside Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to support and optimize clinical decision-making processes.

##Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to classify HCV patients into multiple diagnostic categories based on clinical and laboratory data. Additionally, the project integrates the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method to enhance model transparency, enabling healthcare professionals to interpret individual model predictions and gain trust in the decision support system.
